1. **What does this privacy statement cover?**

This statement describes GORILLADEVS’s customer privacy practices for our GORILLADEVS -branded global SSites, GORILLADEVS services, GORILLADEVS customer sales and marketing activities, and GORILLADEVS customer services and support functions, among others. This statement does not apply to GORILLADEVS employee data practices. This privacy statement does not extend to Overwolf, and Overwolf is not a party to this privacy statement.

Please also note that certain GORILLADEVS Sites, or software experiences may have links to third-party Sites or services. In most cases, those third-party resources are subject to the privacy practices and policies of those third parties and not GORILLADEVS.

2. **What personal, user and product data does GORILLADEVS collect and how does GORILLADEVS use and share the personal data it collects?**

GORILLADEVS may collect certain categories of data about you when you use our Sites; use our services; receive our marketing communications; interact with our customer service and support teams; and in other contexts. The data we collect can be broadly categorized as follows:

- **_Personal Data:_** This is individually identifiable data that you may choose to provide us. This may include basic information such as your email address and phone number, or more sensitive information such as your full date of birth or your payment information.
- **_User Data:_** This is data that we collect from users of our services. User data could include personal data such as your unique GORILLADEVS user ID or account username and password, but sometimes this user data is anonymous or “pseudonymous”, i.e., certain user data that could be made identifiable if associated with personal data.
- **_Location Data_**: This is data we collect that help us determine a location based on your IP address in order to customize our Service and for other uses consistent with this Privacy Statement.

GORILLADEVS has various uses for your personal and user data you provide to us. Here are the principal contexts in which we may use, retain and share your personal and user data:

- **_Sites and Account Management:_** Most often, you may browse our Sites without providing any personal data to us. However, if you choose to establish a user account with GORILLADEVS, engage in e-commerce, sign up for marketing communications, or interact with our customer service teams or participate in a forum on our Site, we will likely need to collect some personal or user data from you. In addition, our web servers automatically collect certain data by default, such as IP addresses and other activity logs. This type of data is used for Site security and site improvement purposes. Much of that data is not readily identifiable and is usually kept anonymous. In order to maintain and improve our Sites, GORILLADEVS uses third party hosting, content management and security partners, vendors and suppliers.
- **_Sales:_** If you decide to purchase a service from GORILLADEVS, we will need to collect certain personal data from you, including payment-related information. Typically, we use third party partners, vendors and suppliers, such as payment processing companies during our sales.
- **_Marketing & Social Media:_** You may choose to receive GORILLADEVS marketing communications, participate in an event/contest/promotion with us, or connect with GORILLADEVS via social media. If you do so, we will collect certain personal data about you, such as your contact information, social media profile information and, in order to determine your eligibility for a contest or promotion, your full or partial dates of birth. GORILLADEVS may share your personal data with our marketing agencies and partners to carry out our marketing campaigns, contests and promotions. If you wish to unsubscribe from our marketing, please follow the opt-out link in the communications you receive from us; update your contact preferences in your GORILLADEVS account settings; or click here.
- **_Product Registration:_** If you use GORILLADEVS services, you may choose to establish a GORILLADEVS user account. A GORILLADEVS user account profile may include your username, password, settings, preferences, contact information, device ID information, and related data. GORILLADEVS may share this information with other GORILLADEVS subsidiaries and affiliates and vendors and suppliers, such as third-party hosting partners. Certain GORILLADEVS product settings, preference information, applications history and location-based information may be used by GORILLADEVS product development and improvement and customer service teams if you choose to enable enhanced customer support services.
- **_Customer Service & Support:_** If you choose to interact with GORILLADEVS customer service and support – whether it be via our Site, social media, chat, email or phone – GORILLADEVS customer service teams (some of whom work for outsourced vendors and suppliers of GORILLADEVS) may have access to your account information, product information, contact information and payment information. You may also be required to answer certain security questions to verify your identity and your call or session with GORILLADEVS customer support may be recorded for quality and training purposes.
- **_Job Opportunities:_** You may choose to apply for employment opportunities at GORILLADEVS through the GORILLADEVS Site. If you complete an application for a job at GORILLADEVS, we may collect your contact information, job history info and certain other information that may be required or allowed under applicable laws to screen candidates for employment. We may share this information with other GORILLADEVS subsidiaries and affiliates and vendors and suppliers who provide us with candidate search and hiring services.

_Hash Email_

A hashed email is a form of data encryption where an email address is converted into a unique string of characters through a cryptographic algorithm. This process ensures that the original email address is not directly accessible, thereby enhancing privacy and security. Hashed emails are commonly used in ad personalization to create a more tailored advertising experience for users.

_Sharing of Hashed Emails_

It is important to clarify that only the hashed version of an email is shared with third-party partners. This means that the original email address remains confidential.

_Opting Out of Hashed Email Use_

We understand that privacy preferences vary among individuals. Therefore, users have the option to opt out of the use of their hashed emails. To do so you can open the in-app settings. We are committed to respecting user choices and ensuring transparency in our data practices.
