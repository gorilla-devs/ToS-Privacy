1. #### What does this privacy statement cover?

This statement describes GORILLADEVS's customer privacy practices for
our GORILLADEVS -branded global websites, GORILLADEVS services,
GORILLADEVS customer sales and marketing activities, and GORILLADEVS
customer services and support functions, among others. This statement
does not apply to GORILLADEVS employee data practices.

Please also note that certain GORILLADEVS websites, or software
experiences may have links to third-party websites or services. In most
cases, those third-party resources are subject to the privacy practices
and policies of those third parties and not GORILLADEVS.

2.  #### What personal, user and product data does GORILLADEVS collect and how does GORILLADEVS use and share the personal data it collects?

GORILLADEVS may collect certain categories of data about you when you
use our websites; use our services; receive our marketing
communications; interact with our customer service and support teams;
and in other contexts. The data we collect can be broadly categorized as
follows:

- **_Personal Data:_** This is individually identifiable data that you
  may choose to provide us. This may include basic information such as
  your email address and phone number, or more sensitive information
  such as your full date of birth or your payment information.

- **_User Data:_** This is data that we collect from users of our
  services. User data could include personal data such as your unique
  GORILLADEVS user ID or account username and password, but sometimes
  this user data is anonymous or "pseudonymous", i.e., certain user
  data that could be made identifiable if associated with personal
  data.

- **_Location Data_**: This is data we collect that help us determine
  a location based on your IP address in order to customize our
  Service and for other uses consistent with this Privacy Statement.

GORILLADEVS has various uses for your personal and user data you provide
to us. Here are the principal contexts in which we may use, retain and
share your personal and user data:

- **_Websites and Account Management:_** Most often, you may browse
  our websites without providing any personal data to us. However, if
  you choose to establish a user account with GORILLADEVS, engage in
  e-commerce, sign up for marketing communications, or interact with
  our customer service teams or participate in a forum on our website,
  we will likely need to collect some personal or user data from you.
  In addition, our web servers automatically collect certain data by
  default, such as IP addresses and other activity logs. This type of
  data is used for website security and site improvement purposes.
  Much of that data is not readily identifiable and is usually kept
  anonymous. In order to maintain and improve our websites,
  GORILLADEVS uses third party hosting, content management and
  security partners, vendors and suppliers.

- **_Sales:_** If you decide to purchase a service from GORILLADEVS,
  we will need to collect certain personal data from you, including
  payment-related information. Typically, we use third party partners,
  vendors and suppliers, such as payment processing companies during
  our sales.

- **_Marketing & Social Media:_** You may choose to receive
  GORILLADEVS marketing communications, participate in an
  event/contest/promotion with us, or connect with GORILLADEVS via
  social media. If you do so, we will collect certain personal data
  about you, such as your contact information, social media profile
  information and, in order to determine your eligibility for a
  contest or promotion, your full or partial dates of birth.
  GORILLADEVS may share your personal data with our marketing agencies
  and partners to carry out our marketing campaigns, contests and
  promotions. If you wish to unsubscribe from our marketing, please
  follow the opt-out link in the communications you receive from us;
  update your contact preferences in your GORILLADEVS account
  settings; or click [here]{.underline}.

- **_Product Registration:_** If you use GORILLADEVS services, you may
  choose to establish a GORILLADEVS user account. A GORILLADEVS user
  account profile may include your username, password, settings,
  preferences, contact information, device ID information, and related
  data. GORILLADEVS may share this information with other GORILLADEVS
  subsidiaries and affiliates and vendors and suppliers, such as
  third-party hosting partners. Certain GORILLADEVS product settings,
  preference information, applications history and location-based
  information may be used by GORILLADEVS product development and
  improvement and customer service teams if you choose to enable
  enhanced customer support services.

- **_Customer Service & Support:_** If you choose to interact with
  GORILLADEVS customer service and support -- whether it be via our
  website, social media, chat, email or phone -- GORILLADEVS customer
  service teams (some of whom work for outsourced vendors and
  suppliers of GORILLADEVS) may have access to your account
  information, product information, contact information and payment
  information. You may also be required to answer certain security
  questions to verify your identity and your call or session with
  GORILLADEVS customer support may be recorded for quality and
  training purposes.

- **_Job Opportunities:_** You may choose to apply for employment
  opportunities at GORILLADEVS through the GORILLADEVS website. If you
  complete an application for a job at GORILLADEVS, we may collect
  your contact information, job history info and certain other
  information that may be required or allowed under applicable laws to
  screen candidates for employment. We may share this information with
  other GORILLADEVS subsidiaries and affiliates and vendors and
  suppliers who provide us with candidate search and hiring services.

The following table provides further information on some of the specific
types of personal or user data we may collect from you, how we use it
and with whom we may share it:
