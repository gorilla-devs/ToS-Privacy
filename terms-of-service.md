**ARBITRATION**

_Dispute resolution and arbitration_

By using this Site, you agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies that you may have against GORILLADEVS arising out of or relating to or connected in any way to (i) your use of this Site (ii) any services obtained from or provided by GORILLADEVS or (iii) this Agreement (including the interpretation and scope of this clause and the arbitrability of the dispute), shall be resolved exclusively by mandatory, binding arbitration initiated through and administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). You further agree that arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA, and that any arbitration proceeding, if necessary, will be held in Wilmington, Delaware or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by GORILLADEVS and you. Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitrator shall apply Delaware law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. In order to initiate arbitration with the AAA, you may be responsible for paying a filing fee to the AAA, however, in the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, GORILLADEVS will reimburse as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. There will be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action or representative basis. **YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU AND GORILLADEVS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THE CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION.** You are thus giving up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, and not a judge or jury.

All claims you bring against GORILLADEVS must be resolved in accordance with this arbitration provision. All claims filed or brought by you contrary to this provision will be considered improperly filed and void. Should you file a claim contrary to this arbitration provision, GORILLADEVS will notify you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you must promptly withdraw the claim. If you fail to promptly withdraw the claim after receiving written notice from GORILLADEVS, GORILLADEVS may recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred to enforce this arbitration provision.

_Notice Process_

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). GORILLADEVS ‘s address for Notice is: <hello@gdlauncher.com>

The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or GORILLADEVS may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or GORILLADEVS shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.

_Enforceability_

If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision was not contained herein.
