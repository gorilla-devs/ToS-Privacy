and all disputes arising of this Agreement, termination, or our
relationship with you shall be determined by applying laws of the State
of Delaware.

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that
part will be struck, and the remaining portions will remain in full
force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of
this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not

not assign your rights under this Agreement without written consent from
GORILLADEVS; GORILLADEVS may assign its rights under this Agreement

#### ARBITRATION

_Dispute resolution and arbitration_

By using this Site, you agree that any and all disputes, claims or
controversies that you may have against GORILLADEVS arising out of or
relating to or connected in any way to (i) your use of this Site (ii)
any services obtained from or provided by GORILLADEVS or (iii) this
Agreement (including the interpretation and scope of this clause and the
arbitrability of the dispute), shall be resolved exclusively by
mandatory, binding arbitration initiated through and administered by the
American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). You further agree that
arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the
applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA, and that any
arbitration proceeding, if necessary, will be held in Wilmington,
Delaware or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by
GORILLADEVS and you. Arbitration will be subject to the Federal
Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitrator shall
apply Delaware law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, and
shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. In order to initiate
arbitration with the AAA, you may be responsible for paying a filing fee
to the AAA, however, in the event you are able to demonstrate that the
costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
litigation, GORILLADEVS will reimburse as much of your filing and
hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems
necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. There
will be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class
action or representative basis. **YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY
ACCEPTING THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU AND GORILLADEVS ARE EACH
WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION
WITH RESPECT TO THE CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION
PROVISION.** You are thus giving up your right to go to court to assert
or defend your rights. Your rights will be determined by a neutral
arbitrator, and not a judge or jury.

All claims you bring against GORILLADEVS must be resolved in accordance
with this arbitration provision. All claims filed or brought by you
contrary to this provision will be considered improperly filed and void.
Should you file a claim contrary to this arbitration provision,
GORILLADEVS will notify you in writing of the improperly filed claim,
and you must promptly withdraw the claim. If you fail to promptly
withdraw the claim after receiving written notice from GORILLADEVS,
GORILLADEVS may recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
incurred to enforce this arbitration provision.

_Notice; Process_

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice
of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or
Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a
physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").
GORILLADEVS 's address for Notice is: hello@gdlauncher.com

The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\"). We
agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we
do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is
received, you or GORILLADEVS may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you
or GORILLADEVS shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. All documents and
information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept
strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the
recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or
the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be
disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for
such purposes or as required by applicable law.

_Enforceability_

If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid,
unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and
Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration
provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance
with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting
provision was not contained herein.

regulations, acts, demands or and orders of any government or agency, or
any other cause which is beyond the control of GORILLADEVS . GORILLADEVS
